Array Manipulation Project
Student ID: 123456

## Task 1

The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as an argument. It returns a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2

The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number. If the number is even, the string is capitalized. If the number is odd, the string is converted to lowercase.

## Task 3

The `createUserProfiles` function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2 as arguments. It returns an array of objects, where each object contains the `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an auto-incremented `id` starting from 1.

## Task 4

This README file explains the purpose of each task and includes the student ID.
